/**
 * AI security for Otter. Two layers of defence keep the assistant a
 * scheduling tool, not a general-purpose chatbot or a prompt-injection target:
 *
 *  1. GUARDRAIL_PREAMBLE - a hardened scope + anti-injection instruction block
 *     prepended to EVERY Otter system prompt. This is the primary control: the
 *     model refuses out-of-scope requests and ignores instructions embedded in
 *     tool data (calendar events, attendee names, booking notes).
 *  2. screenUserInput - a cheap pre-model check that blocks the most blatant
 *     jailbreak / injection attempts before we spend a model call, and logs
 *     them so abuse is observable. Deliberately conservative (injection patterns
 *     only, never topic-guessing) so real scheduling requests are never blocked;
 *     topic scope is left to the model via the preamble.
