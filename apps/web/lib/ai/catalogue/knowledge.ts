/**
 * The Otter knowledge catalogue - a small, curated set of reference documents
 * the assistant can retrieve to ground how-to and best-practice answers.
 *
 * This is SKALLARS Law-specific product knowledge written for grounding, not
 * marketing: how a capability actually works and how to get the best out of it.
 * Otter reaches it through the `search_knowledge` tool - when a host asks "how
 * do I..." or "what's the best way to...", the model pulls the matching
 * article(s) into context and answers from them instead of guessing.
 *
 * Retrieval is keyword + title overlap (a handful of short docs needs nothing
 * heavier than that). Keep each article concise, accurate to what the product
 * actually does, and free of anything that would go stale quickly.

Held focus blocks count as busy in your availability, so booking pages stop offering those slots. For recurring protection, set a weekly automation rule. Best practice: protect focus in the morning before meetings pile up, and keep blocks to 60-120 minutes so they're easy to place.`,

Add reminder channels (email is on by default; Slack, SMS and WhatsApp can be added) so invitees get nudged before the meeting. Require confirmation on high-value booking types so a slot is only held once the guest confirms. Add a short buffer before meetings so back-to-back overruns don't cascade.

For a stretch of days away, set an out-of-office period with a start and end date; while you're away SKALLARS Law shows an "away" banner on your booking page and, if you name a delegate you share a team with, redirects new bookings to them.

Group types allow multiple attendees up to a capacity. Add an access code to keep a type semi-private, or mark it private so it's link-only.
