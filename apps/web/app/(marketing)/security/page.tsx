        <h2>Encryption</h2>
        <p>
          Calendar OAuth tokens, notification-channel secrets, and webhook signing keys are
          encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM. API keys are stored only as SHA-256 hashes - we never
          keep the plaintext. All traffic is served over HTTPS.
        </p>

        <h2>Access & isolation</h2>
        <p>
          Every record belongs to a user and an organization, and every request is scoped to the
          authenticated account - there's no cross-tenant access. The authenticated app is protected
          against clickjacking, and public booking links use unguessable capability tokens.
        </p>

        <h2>Payments</h2>
        <p>
          Payments run through Stripe. We never see or store card numbers - only a customer
          reference. Stripe webhooks are signature-verified and fulfillment is idempotent.
        </p>

        <h2>Outbound webhooks</h2>
        <p>
          Webhooks you configure are delivered from validated, public destinations only (we block
          internal/loopback targets to prevent SSRF), signed with an HMAC over the payload plus a
          timestamp so you can reject replays.
        </p>

        <h2>Self-hosting</h2>
        <p>
          Prefer full control? Self-host {BRAND.name} and your data never leaves your
          infrastructure. See the <a href="/self-hosting">self-hosting guide</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Reporting a vulnerability</h2>
        <p>
          Found something? We appreciate responsible disclosure - email{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${BRAND.email}`}>{BRAND.email}</a> and we'll respond promptly.
        </p>
