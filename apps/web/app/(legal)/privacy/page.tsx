        <p>
          Your calendar is deeply personal. This policy explains what {tenant.name} collects, why,
          and the control you have. In short: we collect the minimum needed to run scheduling for
          you, we never sell your data, and sensitive tokens are encrypted at rest.
        </p>

        <h2>What we collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Account data</strong> - your name, email, timezone, and booking handle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Calendar data</strong> - connections and busy/free times we sync to compute your
            availability. OAuth tokens are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Booking data</strong> - event types, bookings, attendees' names/emails, and any
            intake answers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Usage data</strong> - basic analytics about how the product is used, and (on
            public booking pages) anonymous view counts to power your funnel analytics.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Payment data</strong> - handled by Stripe; we store only a customer/subscription
            reference, never card numbers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How we use it</h2>
        <p>
          To provide scheduling - syncing calendars, computing availability, creating bookings,
          sending reminders and confirmations - and to operate, secure, and improve the Service. We
          process data to perform our contract with you and for our legitimate interest in running a
          reliable product.
        </p>

        <h2>Otter, our AI assistant</h2>
        <p>
          When you use Otter - {tenant.name}'s built-in assistant - the message you send and the
          relevant scheduling context (your event types, availability, and upcoming bookings) are
          sent to our AI provider, Anthropic, to generate a response. Otter is{" "}
          <strong>confirm-first</strong>: it only ever drafts a change and waits for your explicit
          confirmation - it never books, moves, or cancels anything on its own. Our AI provider does
          not use your data to train its models, and we don't use Otter conversations for
          advertising. AI features are optional - if you never use Otter, none of your data is sent
          to an AI provider.
        </p>

        <h2>Google Workspace APIs &amp; Limited Use</h2>
        <p>
          {tenant.name}'s use of information received from Google Workspace APIs (including Google
          Calendar) adheres to the{" "}
          <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy">
            Google API Services User Data Policy
          </a>
          , including the Limited Use requirements. Google user data is used solely to provide and
          improve the user-facing scheduling features you request. We do <strong>not</strong> use,
          transfer, or sell Google Workspace user data - raw, aggregated, or derived - to develop,
          improve, or train generalized or foundational machine-learning or artificial-intelligence
          models, and we do not transfer it to any third party for that purpose. When you use Otter,
          the relevant data is sent to our AI provider only to generate the response you requested,
          and that provider does not use it to train its models.
        </p>

        <h2>How we share it</h2>
        <p>
          We share data only with the processors needed to run the Service - never for advertising,
          and we never sell your personal data. Those processors are listed below.
        </p>

        <h2>Subprocessors</h2>
        <p>We rely on a small set of vendors to operate the Service:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Calendar &amp; conferencing</strong> - Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Zoom, for
            the accounts you choose to connect.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Anthropic</strong> - powers Otter's AI responses, only when you use Otter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stripe</strong> - payments and subscription billing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Resend</strong> - transactional email (confirmations and reminders).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Twilio</strong> - SMS one-time codes and reminders, if you enable them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cloudflare</strong> - bot protection on public booking pages.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Some of these processors are based in the United States; where required, international
          transfers rely on standard contractual clauses.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
          OAuth tokens, notification secrets, and webhook signing keys are encrypted at rest. API
          keys are stored only as hashes. Access is scoped per user and organization. Write to{" "}
          <a href={`mailto:${tenant.email}`}>{tenant.email}</a> if you need more detail than this.
        </p>

        <h2>Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          We use a session cookie to keep you signed in, and - where enabled - a bot-protection
          cookie on public booking pages. We don't use advertising or cross-site tracking cookies.
        </p>

        <h2>Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We keep your data while your account is active. When you delete data or your account, we
          remove it within a reasonable period, except where we must retain records for legal or
          accounting reasons.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, export, or delete
          your data, and to object to certain processing. You can export your bookings from the app
          and manage connections and channels in settings, or email us to exercise any right.
        </p>

        <h2>Self-hosting</h2>
        <p>
          If you self-host {tenant.name}, your data lives on your own infrastructure and this policy
          does not apply - you are the data controller.
        </p>
